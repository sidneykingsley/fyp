# **String Classifier**

**_Neural network_**

### Description:

This small program uses a simple neural network to classify strings. I created it as a test to see if neural networks were intelligent enough to distinguish strings even with slight differences to the structure of them.

### Result:

Unfortunately this experiment ended unsuccessfully with the neural network not capable of seeing text input as quantifiable data.

### The next step:

This experiment led me to return to research and discover word2vec: an algorithm that translates text into numbers making them easier for NNs to infer from.<sup>1</sup>

### Libraries used:

- ML5.js
- p5.js
