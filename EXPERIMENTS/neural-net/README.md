# **Neural Network** created with _ML5_ from a _Daniel Shiffman_ tutorial

**_Neural network_**

### Description:

This program uses a simple neural network to classify XY coordinates of a mouse click within a canvas. I followed a Daniel Shiffman _The Coding Train_ video tutorial. [^1]

### Result:

Unfortunately this experiment ended unsuccessfully with the neural network not capable of seeing text input as quantifiable data.

### The next step:

Creating my own NN with my own purpose, interface and dataset.

### Libraries used:

- ML5.js
- p5.js

### Instructions for use:

- The NN can be trained by clicking on different points of a 2D _p5_ canvas
- Different keys can be pressed before clicking to define different potential outputs for each x and y coordinate
- Corresponding sounds play for the note of the key pressed from range C to E
- T key is pressed to train
- Predictions are shown in green
