# FYP Repository

My name is Sidney Kingsley and I am a third year student studying Digital Media Design (BSc) at the University of Plymouth. This is the git repository for my final year project.

My final year project _(FYP)_ focuses on the **web** application of **machine learning** _(ML)_ to create, understand and interact with art.
