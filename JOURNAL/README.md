### Introduction:

This is the journal for my final year project (FYP).
Throughout this project I will use this as resource to document my progress and reflect on the decisions I have made.

### Proposal:

_14/01/2021_

My FYP will explore the field of artificial intelligence, more specifically: machine learning.

The description featured in my proposal reads:

> A biographical style, future-predicating web app which uses a machine learning (ML) model trained on the different narratives of different people’s lives to estimate what potential future paths exist for a user based upon provided past data. The data for the existing life paths would be extracted from Wikipedia: a vast and well-structured source of biographical information. The web app would feature a thoroughly UX considered Q&A style conversational interface to collect the user’s past life data and then would create a spoof Wikipedia page displaying the new projected biography.
